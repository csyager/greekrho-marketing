        <h1>Rush</h1>
			<p>Rush is one of the most important operations of a student organization. Recruiting new members is how student organizations fund their operations and continue to survive. That's why we've paid special attention to rush and made it one of our most involved features.</p>
			<p>Rushees are able to sign into events as they attend.  At the first events, their information is collected and saved in our databases to be referenced later.  At later events, rushees are able to sign in with just a click, streamlining the process of collecting attendance.  Events are categorized into rounds, and at the end of each round rushees can be either pushed into the next round, or cut from the process.</p>
			<p>During events, members of your organization are able to record notes on rushees, while either endorsing or opposing their admittance.  These endorsements are stored for later reference during the voting process.  Information collected from each of the rushees is also available for easy reference.</p>
			<p>Voting is inherently difficult, so we've done everything we can to make it a more streamlined and efficient process.  With GreekRho, members are able to vote simultaneously from their devices, with the votes being accurately tallied within a few seconds. This removes any uncertainty, while also reducing time spent voting.</p>
