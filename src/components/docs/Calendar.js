        <h1>Calendar</h1>
			<p>The calendar feature is designed to be a one-stop-shop for members of your organization to find information about upcoming events.  Additionally, events marked as public can be seen by other organizations in your community, allowing the community at large to more successfully plan their events.</p>
			<p>Rush Events, Social Events, and Chapter events are automatically populated on the calendar as they are created within the app.  No more cross-referencing calendars, itâ€™s all here, in one secure location.  Clicking on an event on your calendar will bring up the relevant details on that event, making it easy to find details straight from the calendar.</p>
