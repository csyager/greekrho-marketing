        <h1>Resources</h1>
        <p>The Resources feature is meant to be the one-stop shop for members looking for files or important links.  There are two objects that are represented on this page:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Resource files</code>:  Resource files are stored in the cloud, and are accessible to members only.  These files are secure, and can only be accessed via the GreekRho application, so your data is secure.</li>
            <li><code>Resource links</code>:  Resource links are links to external websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Admin users can create Resource files and links to be shared with members.  No more searching through GroupMe or email to share files that were shared, now you can do that right from the GreekRho application.</p>
        </>
