			<p>GreekRho's social feature is a tool for managing attendance at social events. Members of your organization are able to centrally add, remove, and manage lists of attendees for individual events, as well as store groups of attendees to be easily accessed later.  Then, when it comes time for the event, the list is easily searchable, with builtin capability to mark attendance, which is immediately synced between devices.  This central location for managing attendance makes running events easy, while promoting safety for attendees.</p>
